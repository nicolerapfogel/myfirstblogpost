### Art Piece 1

I chose “Code and Noise: The Cinema Snowglobe,” an interactive new media art piece by JD Beltran. While I included a photograph of the piece, the video (linked below) version displays the interactive component more clearly. Beltran is a San Francisco-based artist who explores storytelling in various forms. This piece was displayed Currents New Media 2016 in Santa Fe, New Mexico. I was drawn to the piece for the way it rethinks how we remember places, stories, and experiences. I love to travel and try to remember my experiences through writing, photos, and the occasional souvenir. A snowglobe is a classic example of a souvenir someone might use to remember a travel experience. Typically, any movement makes snow fall but the image inside remains unchanged. Beltran reimagines the idea of a souvenir as a 3D visualization of a moving image. As you turn the snowglobe, you see a moving image of an experience in a particular location. It plays into our ways or remembering and capacities for storytelling. To me, it almost seems like encapsulating a memory into an object.
